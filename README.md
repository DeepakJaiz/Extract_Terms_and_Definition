# Extract_Terms_and_Definition

### Aim 
In this lesson, we will go through the design process of using Llama Index to extract terms and definitions from text, while allowing users to query those terms later. 
At the base level, our objective is to take text from a document, extract terms and definitions, and then provide a way for users to query that knowledge base of terms and definitions. The lesson will go over features from both Llama Index and Streamlit.
